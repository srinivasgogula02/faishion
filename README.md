# fAIshion

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from the struggle of finding complementary clothing items across various e-commerce sites. Often, I'd find a shirt on Amazon that I loved, but couldn't find matching pants on the same site. This frustration led me to think: what if there was a way to mix and match items from different stores seamlessly? This thought was the seed that grew into fAIshion. 🌟

## What We Learned

Through the development of this project, we learned a great deal about integrating multiple APIs, working with AI for image generation, and the complexities of affiliate marketing. We also gained insights into the importance of user experience and community engagement. 📚

## Development

### Front-End
Built with HTML, CSS, and JS for dynamic and responsive user experience. 🌐

### Back-End
Developed using Flask to handle user data and interactions. ⚙️

### Database
Used MySQL 📊

### AI Integration
OutfitAnything and stable diffusion models to integrate AI models for generating images of users wearing their chosen outfits. 🤖

## Time Constraints

We had a vision to allow users to upload their own images and apply clothing combinations directly to them. However, due to time constraints, we couldn't implement this feature in the current iteration. ⌛

## Community and Earnings

Our platform not only connects fashion enthusiasts but also allows them to earn by creating and sharing their favorite combinations. When someone buys through the affiliate links, we earn a commission. A share of this commission goes to the users who added the garments combination to the community. 💸

## Future Plans

Despite the challenges, we're excited about the potential of fAIshion. In the future, we aim to:

- Implement the feature that allows users to upload their images and see the combinations applied directly. 📸
- Enhance our AI capabilities for even better image generation. 🚀
- Expand our affiliate partnerships to include more online stores. 🛍️

## Conclusion

In conclusion, fAIshion is more than just a fashion site. It's a community-driven platform where creativity meets technology, allowing users to discover, share, and earn from their fashion ideas.
